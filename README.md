# Supabase UI Website

---

Supabase UI is being deprecated.
We are moving the components to the main mono repo at [github.com/supabase/supabase](http://github.com/supabase/supabase).

This website will probably be removed/taken down in preference for a storybook documentation site.

The auth component has been moved to it's own repo and package. [github.com/supabase-community/auth-ui](https://github.com/supabase-community/auth-ui). You can also read the docs for auth ui here.

An open source UI component library inspired by Tailwind and AntDesign.

## Vision

We have compiled repetitive UI patterns into components that we use across the Supabase suite of apps and examples. This library gives us a consistent brand, and accelerates our development/prototyping.

We know there is already a large supply of UI libraries available online. This library is primarily to serve Supabase, but we hope that it can also be beneficial for apps that are built with Supabase.

For example, we provide full components (like Auth widgets), which you can simply drop into your website.

Over time, this library will expand to include a broader range of components and customization. By that stage we hope it will be beneficial even to developers outside of the Supabase ecosystem.

## Key Features

### Tailwind friendly

We have compiled a group of aesthetically pleasing components with design inspiration from existing UI libraries and Tailwind UI examples.

We try to allow Tailwind CSS classes be used for animations and we strongly encourage you to use a Tailwind config with Supabase UI.

### Open source

Supabase UI is open source, and MIT licensed (fully permissive).

Supabase UI uses libraries which are also permissively licensed, if they are lightweight, modular, and active. This is better for the ecosystem, rather than doing everything ourselves. These libraries include:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/)
- Libraries which handle design patterns like context menus, toast messages and interactive tables.
